[*] The user used a deleted email address
[*] Information on the form was incorrect
[*] The user was disabled for something other than inactivity such as a hacked account, cheating, or a manual disable

[*] Username: {{ username }}
[*] Email: {{ emailAddress }}
[*] Inactivity Estimate: {{ information }}
{% if proof %}
[*] Proof One: {{ proof }}
{% endif %}
{% if proofTwo %}
