        <li>The Report comment option is specifically for reporting when the Chat Rules have been broken.</li>
        <li>Such as posts containing racism, offensive language, flaming, and other rules violations.</li>
        <li>We encourage all users to use this feature when they see a rules violation of any form.</li>
        <li>This will get quicker action than PMing a staff member will.</li>
        <li>Please restrict the use of this feature to reporting Rules violations, and remember, this is for reporting comments, not replying to them.</li>
    {% endif  %}
</ul>
<p>In short, please include as much detail as possible when reporting. Thank you. </p>
