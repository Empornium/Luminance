<?php

/*
 * The $Types array is the backbone of the reports system and is stored here so it can
 * be included on the pages that need it, but not clog up the pages that don't.
 * Important thing to note about the array:
 * 1. When coding for a non music site, you need to ensure that the top level of the
 * array lines up with the $Categories array in your config.php.
 * 2. The first sub array contains resolves that are present on every report type
 * regardless of category.
 * 3. The only part that shouldn't be self explanatory is that for the tracks field in
 * the report_fields arrays, 0 means not shown, 1 means required, 2 means required but
 * you can't tick the 'All' box.
 * 4. The current report_fields that are set up are tracks, sitelink, link and image. If
 * you wanted to add a new one, you'd need to add a field to the reportsv2 table, elements
 * to the relevant report_fields arrays here, add the HTML in ajax_report and add security
 * in takereport.
